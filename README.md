# The Marvelous Blog
"The Marvelous" is deidcated to analysing the various works that are part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The blog features articles of different types, ranging from informative posts about works and characters to more in-depth articles that explore theories conceived by the authors or gathered from the web.

The blog is available in both Italian and English, thanks to a team of three people. Two members of the team write the posts, while the third member translates the articles from Italian to English in order to publish them in both languages.

The blog was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the source code is available on [Github Pages](https://github.com/themarvelousblog/themarvelousblog) under the BSD-3 license.
